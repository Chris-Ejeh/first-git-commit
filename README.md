# first-git-commit

Very excited to have pushed my first git commit. More to come!!

I receently started learning NodeJS becuase I wanted to get a better undertstanding of sever side programming. 
I found it very interesting but I still prefer frontend development. Atleast now I have a better understanding of how the backend is designed which could really come in handly when designing frontend APIS.
