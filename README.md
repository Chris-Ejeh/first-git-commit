# first-git-commit

Very excited to have pushed my first git commit. More to come!!

I recently started learning NodeJS becuase I wanted to get a better undertstanding of server-side programming. 
I found it very interesting but I still prefer frontend development. Atleast now I have a better understanding of how the backend is designed which could really come in handly when designing frontend APIs, Authentication and Authorizaition, notifications and deployment purposes.
